              A Toll Management System (TMS) integrated with Automatic Toll Collection (ATMS) enhances the efficiency and convenience of toll collection on roadways. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Key Components:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-xl text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-6">
              <li><strong>RFID Technology:</strong> Vehicles are equipped with RFID tags that are detected by toll booths equipped with RFID readers. This allows for automatic identification and toll deduction without the need for stopping.</li>
              <li><strong>Automatic Payment Processing:</strong> When a vehicle passes through a toll plaza, the RFID reader scans the tag and automatically deducts the toll amount from the prepaid account associated with the tag.</li>
              <li><strong>Data Management:</strong> The system collects and manages data on vehicle passages, toll fees collected, and account balances, which helps in monitoring traffic patterns and revenue generation.</li>
              <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Drivers can manage their accounts online or through mobile apps, allowing for easy reloading of their prepaid accounts, checking balances, and viewing transaction history.</li>
              <li><strong>Integration with Traffic Management:</strong> The TMS can be integrated with broader traffic management systems to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance overall road safety.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Benefits:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-xl text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-6">
              <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Reduces wait times at toll booths, improving traffic flow.</li>
              <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Allows for seamless travel without the need for cash transactions.</li>
              <li><strong>Data Insights:</strong> Provides valuable data for infrastructure planning and maintenance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-xl text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-6">
              Overall, the combination of TMS and ATMS leverages technology to streamline toll collection, enhance user experience, and improve operational efficiency.
